No code was necessary for the task of 3.2, seeing as we did not need to print all the permutations at hand, but rather count them. You will therefore only find files related to the tasks of 3.1.

In the repository you will find four files named A.py, B.py, C.py, D.py. All four of these share a lot of code in common but have been tailored to answer the questions to 3.1 a), b), c) and d) respectively.
You can compile the code in a development environment of your choice, or simply run it using Python either in the terminal or by double clicking it in the explorer. In order to run the code of B and C, 
you need to first make sure that you have the external library "matplotlib" installed. If you do not, you can achieve this by running "pip install matplotlib" in your terminal, assuming that you have added 
pip to your system PATH. Otherwise, the code will crash with an error message indicating that the import of the library at the top of the document has failed.

Once you are done running each python script, simply press ENTER in the terminal to terminate the program.

All four of the Python files will print the results to their respective questions in the terminal, in addition to C.py and B.py showing the user the answers in graphs. All four python files have extensive comments before each method to explain the thought-process behind them and how they work.
